ABSTRACT:

The Trip Booking Chatbot using Amazon LEX and LAMBDA aims to simplify the process of booking trips for users. The chatbot, powered by Amazon Web Services, allows users to interact with a conversational interface that can understand natural language and provide relevant responses.

With this chatbot, users can easily book cars and hotels.
